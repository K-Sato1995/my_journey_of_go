# Overview

I basically learn everything in this repo from [Learn Go by writing tests - DEV Community 👩‍💻👨‍💻](https://dev.to/quii/learn-go-by-writing-tests--m63).

# Test cycle

- Write a test
- Make the compiler pass
- Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- Write enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor (using helpers and such)
